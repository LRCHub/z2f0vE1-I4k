[00:01.68] Hello, I'm not sorry that I had to let you go
[00:06.10] There's some things that you should really know
[00:09.40] Listen
[00:12.40] 
[00:10.76] I used to date a rock boy, and he stole my heart
[00:15.93] Had me rolling in the deep so bad
[00:17.86] Anywhere he go, you know I'd go
[00:21.72] Promised me forever, seven days of the week
[00:24.25] But he was too busy getting down in the sheets
[00:26.95] I used to date a rock boy, 'til he broke my heart
[00:51.45] 
[00:33.28] He tried so hard to win me back over
[00:37.07] With a couple melodies
[00:39.96] Had to let him know that he can't play me
[01:00.46] 
[00:43.47] Oh, there's this boy that I know
[00:45.86] He made my heart beat like radio
[00:48.52] It used to go dum-dum, da-da-da-da, dum
[00:51.51] Da-da-da-da, dum, da-da-da, dum
[00:54.15] But now I'm fine, so when his songs
[00:56.74] Are playing loud on the radio
[00:59.78] I'm over that dum-dum, da-da-da-da, dum
[01:02.55] Da-da-da-da, dum, da-da-da, dum
[01:18.05] 
[01:05.30] Hmm, hm-hm-hm-hm
[01:08.33] Hmm-hm
[01:11.33] 
[01:09.78] Oh yeah, my momma taught me
[01:11.93] Never let nobody treat me any less than I deserve
[01:15.08] I'm not a dummy (trust me)
[01:16.85] He's the one that's begging now
[01:18.23] Miss me 'cause I'm not around
[01:19.57] Guess you only know just what you
[01:20.98] Got when it walks out and you best believe
[01:24.75] I'd never give my heart again to somebody
[01:27.36] Like a rock boy (rock boy), 'cause he broke my heart, heart, heart
[02:00.36] 
[01:33.26] He tried so hard to win me back over
[01:37.05] With a couple melodies
[01:39.86] Had to let him know that he can't play me
[02:00.36] 
[01:43.42] Oh, there's this boy that I know
[01:46.09] He made my heart beat a radio
[01:48.83] He used to go dum-dum, da-da-da-da, dum
[01:51.55] Da-da-da-da, dum, da-da-da, dum
[01:54.14] But now I'm fine, so when his songs
[01:57.08] Are playing loud on the radio
[01:59.63] I'm over that dum-dum, da-da-da-da, dum
[02:02.52] Da-da-da-da, dum, da-da-da, dum
[02:18.02] 
[02:06.04] Dum-dum, da-da-da-da, dum (on the radio, radio)
[02:08.70] Dum-dum, da-da-da-da (on the radio, oh)
[02:11.38] Dum-dum, da-da-da-da, dum (on the radio, radio)
[02:13.78] Da-da-dum, di-dum, yeah (on the radio, oh)
[02:16.92] Dum-dum, da-da-da-da, dum (on the radio, radio) (ooh)
[02:19.53] Dum-dum, da-da-da-da (on the radio, oh) (ooh)
[02:22.52] Dum-dum, da-da-da-da, dum (on the radio, radio)
[02:24.81] My heart no longer sings along
[02:28.09] Ha-ha-ha
[02:28.91] Uh-ha-ha-ha
